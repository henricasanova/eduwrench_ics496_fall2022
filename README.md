## eduWRENCH

## Running the Application

### Local installation

Dependencies:
- [WRENCH 1.10](https://github.com/wrench-project/wrench)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Run the build script (compiles all simulators, and configures web application):

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
$ cd server
$ node app.js
```

Start the frontend application:

```bash
$ cd web
$ gatsby develop
```

Open a Web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

### Running with Docker

Dependencies:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```bash
$ docker pull wrenchproject/wrench:1.10
$ mkdir data_server
$ docker-compose build --no-cache
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Enabling SSL deployment

By default, eduWRENCH is configured to run in _SSL disabled_ mode. SSL
support can be enabled by editing the `.env` file. The following variables
need to be defined to enable SSL support:

```bash
# Port number for Gatsby application (frontend)
EDUWRENCH_GATSBY_PORT=443
# Enable SSL connection (true|false)
EDUWRENCH_ENABLE_SSL=true
# Folder where certificates are stored in the local system
EDUWRENCH_SSL_CERTS_DIR=./ssl
# Name of the certificate file
EDUWRENCH_SSL_CERTIFICATE=cert.pem
# Name of the private key file
EDUWRENCH_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY=key.pem
```

If running the **Local installation**, the environment should be set by
running the following command: `$ source .env`. If running with **Docker**
no additional steps are required, since the `.env` file is automatically
read by the `docker-compose` command.
